<p>The Thadingyut Festival which is also called the Burmese Festival of lights is held every full-moon day of the Thadngyut Month in the Burmese Lunar calendar (Thadingyut (Festival of Lights), n.d.). Thadingyut festival is a religious celebration with Buddhist tradition at its core. History said that it is celebrated to welcome the Buddhaâ€™s descent from heaven after he preached the Buddhist religious text Abhidhamma to his mother, Maya, after being reincarnated in the heavens (Thadingyut (Festival of Lights), n.d.). This event turns into a custom, where it is held at the end of the Buddhist sabbath (Vassa) and is the second most popular festival in Myanmar after Thingyan Festival (New Year Water Festival)(Thadingyut (Festival of Lights), n.d.).</p>

<p>During this festival, schools across Myanmar would close. Before the school closes there are nationwide celebration called Sayar Gadaw Pyae, where younger people pay their respect in a way of bowing to the teachers, mentors, employers, monks, and elders. After this people will be rewarded with payments and blessings (ILBC, 2018). This is a common practice around Myanmar. But Thadingyut is a celebration of respect, light, and Buddhism (ILBC, 2018). When you come to Myanmar during the fall season which is considered in Myanmar as Monsoon season. You will experience firsthand the beautiful culture of Thadingyut. With food stalls that donate food and drinks. People will visit pagodas to pay respect to Buddha. And some will fast and meditate in the vicinity of the monastery. Thadingyut is truly a blissful event.  </p>
